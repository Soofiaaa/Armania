# Introduction
Armania is a rpg mostly using real life skills. It is currently in version 1.2 (alpha). <br/>

# What about it
For now, the map is a 10 by 10 blocks. It is still a terminal game but it will come gui a day. <br/>
There is only one type of skill for now and it is wood cutting. <br/>
Wood cutting can be level up by cutting down trees. <br/>
The maximum level you can get is lvl 99. <br/>

# Future
I am currently putting all my time in my life on this game right now. <br/>
I am doing this project solo so it takes some times to make new version but 1.3 will be there soon. <br/>
